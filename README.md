# Build OP-TEE, U-Boot and Linux for RK3229

### Introduction

This documentation details my experience in installing *mainline versions of OP-TEE, U-Boot, Linux and Devuan* on a few devices that are based on Rockchip's RK3229 System-on-Chip.

If you choose to follow this guide, please think for yourself and acknowledge that you take full responsibility for your own actions. If you choose to log an issue, please provide a description of the system you are using for cross-compilation along with the appropriate build logs and a clear explanation of the problem you are experiencing.


### Documentation

- #### Build

     - [Compile OP-TEE, U-Boot and Linux for RK3229](COMPILE.md)


- #### Full Installation

     This approach does not rely on any software that was shipped by the vendor.

     *This will not work for devices that have onboard NAND flash instead of an eMMC, as neither mainline U-Boot nor mainline Linux have support for the Rockchip NAND controller.*

     - [U-Boot + Linux Installation (eMMC)](EMMC-INSTALL.md)
     - [U-Boot + Linux Installation (SD/MMC)](SDMMC-INSTALL.md)


- #### Partition Replacement

     This approach uses the bootloader and Rockchip partitioning scheme shipped by the vendor.

     *This will not work for devices that have onboard NAND flash instead of an eMMC, as mainline Linux does not have a driver for the Rockchip NAND controller.*
