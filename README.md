# Unyoke your RK3229


### Documentation

- #### Build

     - [Compile OP-TEE, U-Boot and Linux for RK3229](COMPILE.md)

- #### Full Installation

     This approach does not rely on any software that was shipped on your device's onboard flash memory. *This will not work for devices that have onboard NAND flash, as neither mainline U-Boot nor mainline Linux have support for the Rockchip NAND controller.*
     - [U-Boot + Linux Installation (eMMC)](EMMC-INSTALL.md)
     - [U-Boot + Linux Installation (SD/MMC)](SDMMC-INSTALL.md)

- #### Partition Replacement

     This approach uses the bootloader and Rockchip partitioning scheme shipped on your device's onboard flash memory. *This will not work for devices that have onboard NAND flash, as mainline Linux does not have a driver for the Rockchip NAND controller.*
